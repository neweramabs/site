    title: antibodies that just work!
    content: |-
      Antibodies are wonderful and reliable tools but the generation so far is tedious and resource wasting. To select suitable antibodies is a highly complex task - time to move forward and use technologies which are future-oriented rather than old-fashioned.\

      Are you ready to enter a new era of antibody generation?

          new/era/mabs builds up a universal comprehensive approach to generate antibody molecules in a future-oriented and smart manner. We created novel transgenic fusion cell lines with an artificial cell surface marker to connect the producing hybridoma with the corresponding secreted antibody. This allows a fast, direct and specific screening for the desired producing cells. It's called: selma™

          This principle is so simple and wonderful - can we use it for other approaches as well? We created a camelid naive library in mammalian cell lines and established a novel type of screening by using selma™. With this approach we can easily select just nanobodies or full length camelid antibodies or camelid/human/murine chimeras - chose your favorite format!

      - title: immunization
        image: images/nem-immunization.png
        content: |-
          We base our immunization strategy onto the most efficient danger signals to the mammalian immune system: viruses. By combining efficient surface-related epitopes with a viral particle system originated from the hamster polyomavirus, we are able to perform a hyper-immunization schedule, extraordinary faster than conventional immunization strategies. In close cooperation with our customers we discuss and plan the immunization strategy and epitope screening. We guarantee a surface-related presentation of the target epitope within the viral backbone. This flexibility provides the advantage of  inducing a highly potent and antigen specific immune response to the native target.
      - title: selma™
        image: images/nem-selma.png
        content: |-
          Since decades selection of antibody producing hybridoma cells is performed by limited dilution and excessive ELISA screening in order to find suitable antibody-producing cells. These processes are very laborious, time-consuming and expensive. This dilemma motivated us to dig deeper to develop new technologies, strategies and applications. We developed selma™: Our selma™ technology is based on  transgenic myeloma cell lines expressing an artificial surface marker. These enable us to link the antigen-specific antibody and the secreting hybridoma cell. Moreover, the system allows a flexible screening for wanted isotypes and wanted or non-wanted cross-reactivities. In combination with our viral immunization system the process of reliable antibody generation and validation is hence finished within less than 3 months.
      - title: generation of camelid heavy-chain antibodies
        image: images/nem-camelid-heavy-chain.png
        content: |-
          For some applications conventional antibodies might not be suitable due to their size or the size of the requested antigen. Therefore, we offer the generation of recombinant camelid heavy-chain only antibodies. Those antibodies - highly stable and small in size - reveal a complete new spectrum of antigen-binding in the field of biodiagnostics. We can draft the variable binding part to the constant part of the camelid immunoglobulin in order to produce recombinant camelid heavy-chain only full length antibody molecules or any chimeric options you need for your projects.
      - title: transgenic cells
        image: images/nem-transgenic-cells.png
        content: |-
          Beside our customized antibody generation systems, we provide the genetic engineering of mammalian cells. Initially we optimize your sequence of interest with the help of bioinformatics tools e.g. Kozak consensus sequence. In use of a transposon related expression vector we stably insert your genes of interest and obtain transgenic cell lines expressing the requested protein. After a strong puromycin-based selection we provide cells expressing the protein to 100%. We validate the cells via SDS-Page, Western Blot, Confocal-Microscopy or other application discussed before in line with our clients. We ship the cells with a detailed cultivation protocol and validation report.

          I'm a molecular biologist and a PCR master. I joined new/era/mabs in 2018. I give great attention to details and focus on optimized protocols for the best handling of our generated antibodies. My principle? A good preparation is half of the battle… That´s always true.

          I´m a biochemist and joined new/era/mabs in 2019. My research is focused on camelid immune cells and antibody induction. I love to deal with different characters, ideas and cooperation partners keep calm even in stressful situations. My secret is asana yoga which restores my energy and balance.

          I founded new/era/mabs with a vision - I want to establish options for scientists to think out of the box and encourage them to try new work models, learn from mistakes and use them for unconventional solutions. I love to combine research and application and the development of new technologies which are able to make the world better.

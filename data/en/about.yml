      new/era/mabs builds up a universal comprehensive approach to generate antibody molecules in a future-oriented and smart manner. 
      For monoclonal antibody development we combine a powerful immunisation and selection strategy leading to a process which is 4 times faster than conventional hybridoma technology. 
      By the way, if you use our approaches you can easily select for specific isotypes, different antigen-specificities or wanted/unwanted cross-reactivities - simply by using our selma approach.

      Also for recombinant antibody production we developed mammalian cell lines based on our  selection principle. This allows a reliable and fast selection of suitable recombinant binders. We have established a camelid phage library in this system enabling a flexible generation and selection of either camelid nanobodies or also camelid full length antibodies - right according to your needs. 
      Looking for secondary anti-camelid detection antibodies? Ask us - we can provide an allround solution with mouse monoclonal antibodies specific to camelid IgG1 or IgG2/3.

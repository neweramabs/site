      new/era/mabs builds up a universal comprehensive approach to generate antibody molecules in a future-oriented and smart manner. 
      We created novel transgenic fusion cell lines with an artificial cell surface marker to connect the producing hybridoma with the corresponding secreted antibody. This allows a fast, direct and specific screening for the desired producing cells. 
      LetÂ´s call it: selma

      This principle is so simple and wonderful - can we use it for other approaches as well? 
      We created a camelid naive library in mammalian cell lines and established a novel type of screening by using selma. With this approach we can easily select just nanobodies or full length camelid antibodies or camelid/human/murine chimeras - chose your favorite format!
